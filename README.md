<h1>⚙️ India’s Dairy</h1>

**India is the world’s largest milk producer, powered by millions of small and medium farms spread across rural regions. Major brands like Amul, Mother Dairy, and Sudha drive strong regional dominance through wide sourcing networks and consistent value-added product demand. Rising consumption of curd, paneer, butter, and packaged milk continues to push revenue growth, while challenges remain in cold-chain logistics and livestock health. Modern farms are gradually adopting automation, better feed management, and sustainability practices to improve quality and reduce costs. Overall, India’s dairy sector is expanding steadily, linking rural livelihoods with growing urban markets.**
